To connect to an Oracle database using Python, you typically use the `cx_Oracle` library. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install the cx_Oracle Library

You can install `cx_Oracle` using pip:

```bash
pip install cx_Oracle
```

### Step 2: Install Oracle Instant Client

You need Oracle Instant Client to use `cx_Oracle`. Download and install it from the [Oracle Instant Client downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html). Ensure that the library path environment variable is set correctly.

### Step 3: Connect to the Oracle Database

Here is a basic example of how to connect to an Oracle database and execute a query:

```python
import cx_Oracle

# Define connection parameters
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
dsn = 'your_dsn'  # e.g., 'localhost/orclpdb'

# Establish the connection
connection = cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, dsn)

# Create a cursor
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

# Fetch and print the results
for row in cursor:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

### Step 4: Handling the Connection String

The `dsn` (Data Source Name) can be a TNS name, an Oracle Easy Connect string, or a full Oracle Net Service Name. Here’s an example using Easy Connect:

```python
dsn = cx_Oracle.makedsn("hostname", port, service_name="your_service_name")
connection = cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, dsn)
```

### Step 5: Using Environment Variables (Optional)

For security reasons, it’s often better to use environment variables for your database credentials:

```python
import os
import cx_Oracle

username = os.getenv('DB_USERNAME')
password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
dsn = os.getenv('DB_DSN')

connection = cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, dsn)
```

### Example Using Context Manager

Using a context manager ensures that the connection and cursor are properly closed, even if an error occurs:

```python
import cx_Oracle

username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
dsn = 'your_dsn'

with cx_Oracle.connect(username, password, dsn) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
        for row in cursor:
            print(row)
```

This setup should help you establish a connection to an Oracle database using Python and execute basic queries.
